# quotespy_streamlit

A live demo of the quotespy Python library.

[quotespy](https://pypi.org/project/quotespy/) is a Python library developed by me to create quotes/lyrics and tweet graphics, based on the [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) library.

This app was developed using [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/). As described in the documentation, "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science".

The app is deployed on Heroku, available [here](). With it, you can create quotespy graphics on the web. In other words, you can create graphics similar to tweet screenshots and "free-form" graphics with centered text using the two modules available.
